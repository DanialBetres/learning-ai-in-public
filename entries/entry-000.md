# Entry 0: Why I'm Doing This

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**TL;DR:** I'm committing to being AI-first as a developer and documenting the journey from the start.

---

## The Problem

My company has a Slack channel called `dev-ai-guild`. Engineers in there are talking about custom MCP servers, agent workflows, prompt engineering - and every time I read those messages, I feel a little more behind.

I'm not alone. A lot of engineers use AI - ChatGPT for quick questions, Cursor for autocomplete - but know they're barely scratching the surface. When the only voices in the room are experts, everyone else stays quiet.

## Where I'm Starting From

I've been using **Cursor** with the chat window pinned to the side for about a year. Ask it questions, have it suggest improvements, use **plan mode** to map out changes. Had some real success with that.

But that's been my ceiling - a chatbot sitting next to my editor.

Meanwhile, engineers keep talking about how **Claude Code** has transformed their throughput - not just answering questions, but actually driving the work. I realized I needed to go deeper.

## The Plan

I'm committing to being **AI-first**: before I do something the old way, I'll try the AI way first. If it's faster, great. If it's not, I'll document why.

And I'm doing it in public - no polishing, no pretending. I started this journey a few weeks ago, so my first few entries are a reflection of where I began. Future entries will come as I learn new tools and techniques.

If you're in a similar position, follow along. Let's figure this out together.
