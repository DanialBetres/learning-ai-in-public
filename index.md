# Learning AI in Public

A developer's honest diary of going AI-first. Starting from the basics, learning in public, and documenting every win, mistake, and "aha" moment along the way.

If you're an engineer who feels behind on the AI wave, this is for you. No pretending to be an expert. Just real notes from someone figuring it out.
